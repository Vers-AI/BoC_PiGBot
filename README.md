# PiG_Bot - Bits of Code Bot

Welcome to PiG_Bot, the example bot showcased in the "Bits of Code" series! This bot is designed as a starting point for those looking to dive into the world of AI bot development in StarCraft II using the Python-SC2 framework.

## Episode Feature
PiG_Bot was featured in an episode of "Bits of Code," which you can watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN2WDx0iwG9V2BehVgv-tg_U0OcrWAdKP). The episode walks you through the bot's strategy of mimicking the StarCraft commentator/player PiG, using his Bronze to GM strategies.

## Strategy

2. Adapt to various in-game situations using pre-defined strategies.
